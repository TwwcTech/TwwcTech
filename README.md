ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm a self-taught, full-stack developer specializing in desktop applications using C#. My journey in the world of programming began in 2020 with Python, which laid the foundation for my understanding of programming concepts. However, in May 2023, I discovered my true passion - C# - and realized it was the perfect fit for my interest in desktop application development.

ðŸŽ“ I'm always learning and improving my skills. The beauty of being self-taught is the freedom to explore and dive deep into topics that fascinate me. I believe in the power of continuous learning and the growth that comes with it.
