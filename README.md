Hi, I'm a self-taught fullstack developer who loves to create desktop applications using C#. I started programming in Python in 2020, but switched to C# in May 2023 after realizing it was the perfect language for my goals. I'm always learning new things and exploring new possibilities with code. 

You can find more of my work on my GitHub profile. I'm also open to collaborating with other developers on interesting and challenging projects. Feel free to contact me if you want to chat or work with me. Thanks for visiting my page! 😊.
